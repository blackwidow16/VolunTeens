        <div>Hey! I’m a rising senior at San Leandro High School in San Leandro, CA. I enjoy sleeping, watching tv shows, and hanging out with my friends. I’m a part of a community service club called Key Club and that’s what inspired me to want to help create Volunteens.</div>

        <div>Hello! My name is Samantha Nava-Monje. I am a rising junior at Everest Public High School in RedwoodCity. A couple interests of mine are playing tennis, doing makeup, & trying new things with my family! I love giving back to those in need. It’s always good to do a good deed at least twice a week! I hope the information we provide is helpful for you to give a good deed.</div>
