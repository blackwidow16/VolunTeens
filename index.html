        <p><b>We are a group of teens who love to volunteer and help other people. </b></p>
        <p><b> We are the VolunTeens. </b></p>
        <p>We know that volunteering is a graduation requirement in most Bay Area high schools and that finding a place where you can volunteer may be difficult.
        Whether to fulfill school requirements or just to contribute to your community, we are here to help.
        Volunteering means meeting new people, learning new skills, gaining service credits, securing employment references,
        learning more about city government, and finding personal satisfaction - all while making a difference within the community. </p>
